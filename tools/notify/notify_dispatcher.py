"""notify_dispatcher: the VS-3 notification dispatcher (PR-5).

Contract: tools/notify/README.md; delivery.schema.json; docs/
REPLAY_CONTRACT.md §13. The dispatcher is transport only: it filters,
orders and translates events for delivery (§13.1) — it never judges,
upgrades or rewrites a fact.

Two modes (README §0/§1/§11):

One-shot sweep (default; the backward-compatible form):
  1. read the event ledger (read-only; a concurrently-appending tail is
     skipped, never half-consumed);
  2. apply the notification policy (min_severity, default INFO = all);
  3. suppress duplicates: an ACCEPTED (event_id, device_id) pair is
     never sent again; a FAILED pair is terminal (UNREGISTERED token,
     SENDER_ID_MISMATCH config error, unknown permanent codes);
  4. send one FCM HTTP v1 notification+data message per remaining pair;
  5. append one delivery record per outcome (PENDING on retryable
     failures, ACCEPTED / FAILED otherwise) — append-only, fsynced, so
     a crash between send and record replays the send on restart:
     the device may receive a duplicate push. That is FCM reality, not
     a bug, and the app identifies duplicates by event_id (README §6).
     accepted != delivered: HTTP 200 proves provider acceptance only.

Resident watch (--watch <abs events file>): the process stays alive and
owns BOTH ledgers as their single writer (one exclusive flock per file;
the event ledger is opened with the writer lock). Each tick
(watch_poll_seconds, default 1.0):
  a. stat the watched file — a missing file is a wait, not an error;
  b. a changed (st_dev, st_ino) means the producer recreated the file:
     reopen from offset 0 (full rescan — the ledger's event_id dedup
     makes the rescan idempotent);
  c. st_size < offset is an append-only violation: LedgerFault (exit 4),
     never a silent rescan;
  d. read from the byte offset and take only LF-terminated lines — LF
     is the commit marker; a partial tail is never consumed and the
     offset stays at the byte after the last LF;
  e. ingest the batch all-or-nothing (notify_ledger.EventLedger.
     ingest_lines): an invalid batch is not appended, the offset does
     not advance, a stderr alarm names the fault, and the same batch is
     retried next tick;
  f. run ONE dispatch pass over the pairs whose retry is due now. The
     retry wait is deferred between ticks (next_due = now + wait, no
     in-sweep sleep): a 429 Retry-After wait never delays a new event.
     Nothing is parked — the resident worker resumes its own pairs.

SIGTERM/SIGINT request a clean stop: the current tick finishes, the
single-writer locks are released and the process exits 0. All stdout
lines of the resident mode carry an ISO timestamp prefix.

Retry classes (vendor table, tools/notify/README.md §5):
  429 QUOTA_EXCEEDED / 500 INTERNAL / 503 UNAVAILABLE / transport
  failure -> stay PENDING, backoff >= max(retry_min_seconds, Retry-After):
  the one-shot sweep retries in-sweep while the wait is within
  backoff_cap_seconds and parks PENDING otherwise (external scheduler
  resumes); the resident watch defers the pair and keeps serving;
  404 UNREGISTERED (the REST wire spells it NOT_FOUND — google.rpc
  canonical name for 404; classify_send retires on either) -> FAILED,
  token retired in the registry, no retry;
  403 SENDER_ID_MISMATCH -> FAILED (config error, fail-closed, no
  retry), the sweep keeps serving the other devices and the process
  exits 3 — a config error is never a clean success;
  everything else -> FAILED with the provider's status kept verbatim.

Exit codes (README §9): 0 sweep completed / clean shutdown, 2
usage/config violation, 3 credential failure or fail-closed sender
mismatch, 4 single-writer conflict / internal fault / ledger contract
violation (watched file shrank).
